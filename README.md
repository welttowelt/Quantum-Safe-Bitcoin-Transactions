## Overview

Quantum Safe Bitcoin (QSB) enables signing Bitcoin transactions in a way that remains secure even against an adversary with a large-scale quantum computer running Shor's algorithm. The scheme requires **no changes to the Bitcoin protocol** — it operates entirely within the existing legacy script constraints (201 opcodes, 10,000 bytes).

### The Problem

Standard Bitcoin transactions rely on ECDSA signatures over the secp256k1 curve. Shor's algorithm can efficiently compute discrete logarithms, allowing a quantum adversary to forge ECDSA signatures — breaking the fundamental security assumption that protects Bitcoin transactions.

### Our Approach

QSB builds on [Binohash](https://robinlinus.com/binohash.pdf) (Linus, 2026), which uses a HORS-like one-time signature scheme embedded in Bitcoin Script. Binohash achieves transaction integrity through a proof-of-work puzzle based on signature sizes (`OP_SIZE`). However, this puzzle relies on the assumption that the smallest known ECDSA `r`-value cannot be improved — a quantum adversary running Shor's algorithm could compute the discrete logarithm of `r = 1`, breaking the puzzle entirely.

QSB replaces this with a **hash-to-signature puzzle**: the script hashes a transaction-bound public key via `OP_RIPEMD160` and interprets the 20-byte output as a DER-encoded ECDSA signature. A random 20-byte string satisfies the DER structural constraints with probability ~2^-46 — providing the proof-of-work target. Since this puzzle depends only on the pre-image resistance of RIPEMD-160 (not on any elliptic curve assumption), it is **fully resistant to Shor's algorithm**.

### Key Properties

- **Quantum safe**: Security relies on hash pre-image resistance, not ECDSA. ~118-bit second pre-image resistance under Shor; ~59-bit under Grover.
- **No protocol changes**: Uses only existing Bitcoin consensus rules (legacy P2SH transactions).
- **Practical cost**: ~$75–$150 in cloud GPU compute for the off-chain search, with embarrassingly parallel scaling.
- **Non-standard transaction**: Requires submission via a miner-direct service (e.g., Slipstream) since the transaction exceeds standard relay policy limits.

### How It Works

```
  TRANSACTION PINNING              DIGEST ROUND (×2)

  Hardcoded signature              Choose t of n dummy sigs
  commits to SIGHASH_ALL           (= the digest)
           |                                |
           v                                v
  Changing the tx changes          Verify Lamport signature
  the derived key                  (HORS preimages)
           |                                |
           v                                v
  +----------------------+        Subset determines sighash
  | Hash the key — must  |        (via FindAndDelete)
  | produce a valid sig  |                  |
  | (~2^46 work)         |                  v
  +----------------------+        +----------------------------+
                                  | Derive key, hash it —      |
  Any tx modification             | must produce valid sig     |
  requires new puzzle solve       | (hash-to-sig puzzle)       |
                                  +----------------------------+
```

The spending process has three phases:

1. **Transaction pinning**: Search over `(sequence, locktime)` pairs until the recovered public key's RIPEMD-160 hash is a valid DER signature. This pins the transaction to a specific set of parameters (~2^46 work).

2. **Digest rounds (×2)**: For the pinned transaction, search over subsets of dummy signatures. Each subset produces a different `scriptCode` (via `FindAndDelete`), yielding a different sighash and thus a different recovered public key. Find a subset whose recovered key hashes to a valid DER signature (~2^46 candidates per round).

3. **Assembly**: Recover all public keys, extract HORS preimages, and construct the final spending transaction with the full witness.

The indices of the selected dummy signatures in each round form a **digest** — a compact, collision-resistant identifier of the transaction, analogous to a hash-based signature.

### Why Is This Quantum Safe?

The security of standard Bitcoin transactions rests on ECDSA — broken by Shor's algorithm. QSB replaces every security-critical component with hash-based alternatives:

- **Transaction pinning** depends on RIPEMD-160 pre-image resistance, not ECDSA hardness. A quantum adversary gains no advantage from Shor's algorithm; only Grover's quadratic speedup applies.
- **The Lamport signature** (HORS) uses hash commitments — the spender reveals preimages of committed hashes, which a quantum computer cannot forge.
- **ECDSA is used only as a vehicle**, not as a security assumption. The scheme exploits the fact that Bitcoin Script can verify ECDSA signatures (`OP_CHECKSIG`), but the *hardness* comes from hashing, not from the elliptic curve.

The result: ~118-bit pre-image security under Shor (roughly halved under Grover), compared to 0-bit security for standard ECDSA transactions.

### The Hash-to-Signature Puzzle

The core innovation is the hash-to-signature puzzle. A DER-encoded ECDSA signature has rigid structural constraints — specific tag bytes (`0x30`, `0x02`), internally consistent length fields, and positive integer values. A random 20-byte string satisfies all of these with probability ~2^-46.

The puzzle works as follows: the locking script contains a hardcoded ECDSA signature `sig_nonce` with a known `(r, s)`. When the spender provides a public key `key_nonce`, the script:

1. Verifies `(sig_nonce, key_nonce)` via `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY` — this binds `key_nonce` to the current transaction's sighash.
2. Computes `OP_RIPEMD160(key_nonce)` — producing a 20-byte hash.
3. Interprets this hash as a signature `sig_puzzle` and verifies it via another `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY`.

Step 3 succeeds only if the hash happens to be valid DER — a ~2^-46 event. Since `key_nonce` is determined by the transaction (via step 1), modifying any part of the transaction changes `key_nonce`, changes the hash, and almost certainly breaks step 3. This is the proof-of-work: finding a transaction whose derived key hashes to valid DER.

### Constraints and Tradeoffs

The scheme operates under Bitcoin's tightest constraints:

- **201 non-push opcodes** — every opcode counts, limiting the number of signature selections per round.
- **10,000 byte script size** — must fit ~150 dummy signatures, ~150 hash commitments, and all verification logic across two rounds.
- **Bare script output** — the script exceeds P2SH's 520-byte redeem script limit, so it must be placed directly in the scriptPubKey.
- **Non-standard transaction** — exceeds default relay policy, requiring miner-direct submission (e.g., via Slipstream).

These constraints force careful parameter tuning. The "bonus key" optimization adds cheap subset selections (3 opcodes each vs. 9 for full selections) to match the combinatorial search space to the fixed ~2^46 puzzle target — eliminating grinding overhead while staying within the opcode budget.

## Configuration

| Config | n | t1 | t2 | Opcodes | Digest | Pre-image | Cost |
|--------|---|----|----|---------|--------|-----------|------|
| Baseline | 150 | 8 | 8 | 197 | 84.5b | 2^138 | ~$75-150 |
| **Config A** | **150** | **8+1b** | **7+2b** | **201** | **80.4b** | **2^118** | **~$75-150** |

## Measured Performance

| GPU | Pinning rate | Digest rate |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| RTX 4070 SUPER | 88 M/s | 82 M/s |
| RTX PRO 6000 (Blackwell) | 238 M/s | ~160 M/s (est.) |

## Cost Breakdown (Config A)

| Phase | Candidates | Est. cost |
|-------|-----------|-----------| 
| Pinning | ~2^46.4 | $25–$50 |
| Digest round 1 | C(150,9) ≈ 2^46.2 | $25–$50 |
| Digest round 2 | C(150,9) ≈ 2^46.2 | $25–$50 |
| **Total** | | **$75–$150** |

The computation is embarrassingly parallel — wall-clock time scales inversely with the number of GPUs.

## Key Technical Details

- **DER probability**: 2^-46.4 at consensus level (sighash byte unconstrained; `SCRIPT_VERIFY_STRICTENC` is policy-only)
- **Search space**: sequence (32 bits) × locktime (32 bits) = 2^64 candidates for pinning
- **Midstate trick**: SHA-256 precomputation over ~5KB fixed scriptCode prefix reduces per-candidate cost to 2-3 SHA-256 blocks
- **EC recovery**: CudaBrainSecp precomputed GTable (16 chunks × 65536 points) for fast scalar multiplication on GPU
